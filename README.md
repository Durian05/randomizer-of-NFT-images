# randomizer-of-NFT-images
a special program that makes random nft images, with very convenient functionality, it allows you to configure the parameters exactly for the user.

and so first you need to download unity, I tried to make the program independent, but there were a lot of new nuances and decided to leave it in unity.

download the Unity 2020 version.3.18f1 can be higher, but I did the project on this version of unity

download my project   https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hUW9b9wST21XniI3oz-e3JotCDc9cd7G?usp=sharing

in the unity hub, select "add" and select the "randomizator" folder

in the project itself, you don't need to change anything, the only thing you may have to change is the resolution, for a good display, put 800 by 800

now you need to do the last thing, in the "Resources" folder you need to move all the folders in which you store your pictures, all folders should be sorted by layers.

for example, in the hats folder I have all the caps of my future nft, if you want to upload your nfts to opensea after randomization and you need to save all the properties, then you need to name each picture with the real name of the property
